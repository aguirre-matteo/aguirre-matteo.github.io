I started to use Linux in 2024 and rapidly fell in love with the open source community and decided to become a Linux SysAdmin. I\u0026rsquo;m currently learning all the tools and skills that are needed in a typical job, like managing and configuring services such as DHCPs, DNSs, Web servers, and working with containers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve studied English for around 2-3 years, but mainly acquired it due to fully immersing myself in the language and only consuming content in that language. I could say I\u0026rsquo;m proficient at reading and writting text in English, but I still have to practice my pronounciation.\nI also self-studied Calculus and other advanced Math topics such as Statistics, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. I\u0026rsquo;ve a great foundation in Algebra, which made it easier to learn those topics.\nI store all my knowledge in the form of a blog in my personal website, so feel free to take a look at it! If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for someone focused in learning and doing the job the right way, then you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place.\nEmail: aguirre-matteo@proton.me Website: https://aguirre-matteo.github.io/ Tech Stack # Programming Languages # DevOps # Operating Systems # Coming soon # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Aguirre Matteo's personal website","summary":"","title":"Aguirre Matteo's personal website","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/encryption/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Encryption","type":"tags"},{"content":" Overview # SSH (Secure SHell) is a protocol designed to securely communicate with a remote computer. It validates the identity of user and encrypts all the data is send between the devices. It\u0026rsquo;s widely used to run commands on a server over the internet and transfer files in a secure way. In this guide, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to install SSH, configure it, and how you can use it to connect to your servers.\nBasic Syntax # The basic syntax for using the SSH command is as follows:\nssh [username]@[ip-address] Where we replace username with your remote server username, and ip-address with the server\u0026rsquo;s IP address.\nSetup # Installation # Depending if we\u0026rsquo;re on our server, or on our local machine, we have to install the openssh-server and openssh-client packages respectively.\nIn the case of Debian/Ubuntu-based system, we open the terminal and run:\nsudo apt install openssh-server sudo apt install openssh-client Or if we are using RHEL or a derivative, we run instead:\nsudo dnf install openssh-server sudo dnf install openssh-clients Then we should start the SSH service on our server. We do so running the following commands:\nsudo systemctl enable ssh # Enables the service, starting at system boot. sudo systemctl start ssh # Manually starts the service. If we have a firewall enabled, we should also open the port 22, so we can reach our SSH server. For example, if we\u0026rsquo;re using ufw, we can open the port running this command:\n# UFW will translate SSH to port 22 sudo ufw allow ssh Server Configuration # Now that we have installed SSH, it\u0026rsquo;s time to tweak its config file. We can find it at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. It provides a large number of options which we can find in the manual running man sshd_config. Here I show you an example configuration, which modifies the most commonly used options:\n# Which port SSH should use. It\u0026#39;s highly recommended to keep it # at 22, since it could break your setup. Port 22 # Prevents the clients from login as root. Keep this at false, # and use sudo instead when needed. PermitRootLogin no # Enables Public Key Autentication, making it posible to login # using a SSH key instead of using a password. PubkeyAutentication yes # You\u0026#39;ll only be able to auth to your server using SSH keys. # Make sure you add your keys before disabling this. PasswordAuthentication no # Users the clients are allowed to login as. # Other users will be disabled. AllowUsers myssh-user another_user AllowGroups ssh_users # Users the clients shouldn\u0026#39;t be able to login as. # Other users will be enabled. DenyUsers root DenyGroups important_users After editing the file, we should restart the SSH service running sudo systemctl restart ssh.\nRemote Access # Now that our server is configured, we can connect to it using the ssh command. In this example, I access a Debian virtual machine:\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ ssh myssh-user@192.160.122.230 myssh-user@192.160.122.230\u0026#39;s password: Linux deb-homelab 6.1.0-37-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.140-1 (2025-05-22) x86_64 The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

We have to type yes and press Enter, then the server will be added to our list of known hosts.\nSSH Keys # SSH keys are a more powerful method to authenticate to your servers, making your connection more secure and allowing to login without being asked for the password. To use SSH keys we first have to generate a public-private key pair. To do so we use the ssh-keygen command. We\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to enter the path where we want to save the key pair. I\u0026rsquo;ll save mine at ~/.ssh/ and call it myserver.\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ ssh-keygen Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.

Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to add our keys to our server using the ssh-copy-id command.\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/myserver myssh-user@192.160.122.230 /run/current-system/sw/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \u0026#34;/home/matteo/.ssh/myserver.pub\u0026#34; /run/current-system/sw/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed /run/current-system/sw/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys myssh-user@192.160.122.230\u0026#39;s password: Number of key(s) added: 1 Now try logging into the machine, with: \u0026#34;ssh -i /home/matteo/.ssh/myserver \u0026#39;myssh-user@192.160.122.230\u0026#39;\u0026#34; and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added. [matteo@nixos:~]$ We enter the password for the last time, and then it\u0026rsquo;ll print in the screen that our keys were successfully added. Now we can connect to our server using the -i flag, followed by the path to the key.\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/myserver myssh-user@192.160.122.230 Linux deb-homelab 6.1.0-37-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.140-1 (2025-05-22) x86_64 The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

We wasn\u0026rsquo;t prompted for entering the password!\nFile Transfer # SSH allows us to access the filesystem of our remote server in a safe way, encrypting the files, ensuring no one without permissions can read the contents. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the scp and sftp commands to take advantage of SSH\u0026rsquo;s features to work with our server\u0026rsquo;s files.\nSCP # STP stands for Secure Copy and, as the name suggests, scp is an extended version of the cp command which can be used to copy files from our server. The syntax of scp is the same as the cp command:\nscp [from] [to] Where both from and to can be in an extended form of SSH\u0026rsquo;s target syntax, which uses a : to specify the path:\n[username]@[ip-address]:/path/to/file For example, if we want to copy a shell script to our server, we\u0026rsquo;ll do something like this:\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ scp ./bash-script.sh \\ myssh-user@192.160.122.230:/home/myssh-user/scripts/ \\ -i /home/matteo/.ssh/myserver bash-script.sh 100% 83 26.7KB/s 00:00 [matteo@nixos:~]$ Since we\u0026rsquo;re using an SSH key to connect to the server, we weren\u0026rsquo;t prompted to enter the password. We can also copy entire directories using the -r flag. For example, if we want to copy all the logs from the server to our computer, we do the following:\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ scp -r myssh-user@192.160.122.230:/var/log/ ./logs \\ -i /home/matteo/.ssh/myserver [matteo@nixos:~]$ ls log/ alternatives.log dpkg.log fontconfig.log private alternatives.log.1 dpkg.log.1 installer README alternatives.log.2.gz dpkg.log.2.gz journal runit apt faillog lastlog wtmp [matteo@nixos:~]$ SFTP # SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol. It\u0026rsquo;s an improved version of the FTP protocol to use SSH to encrypt the communication, and it allows us to interactively access the remote filesystem providing commands like ls, cd, mkdir, rm, amoung others. To use it we have to run sftp and pass our server as the argument:\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ sftp myssh-user@192.168.122.160 \\ -i /home/matteo/.ssh/myserver Connected to 192.168.122.160. sftp\u0026gt; By default, sftp will put us in the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. We can verify so typing pwd in the new shell:\nsftp\u0026gt; pwd Remote working directory: /home/myssh-user sftp\u0026gt; I have some Markdown files that I want to copy to the server. To do so we can use the put command, followed by the name of the files. Some commands related to the FS can be executed locally prefixing them with the letter l, such as ls, cd, mkdir, pwd and umask.\nsftp\u0026gt; lls nixos-hardware.md ssh-tutorial.md sftp\u0026gt; put nixos-hardware.md Uploading nixos-hardware.md to /home/ami/nixos-hardware.md nixos-hardware. 100% 0 0.0KB/s 00:00 sftp\u0026gt; put ssh-tutorial.md Uploading ssh-tutorial.md to /home/ami/ssh-tutorial.md ssh-tutorial. 100% 0 0.0KB/s 00:00 sftp\u0026gt; ls nixos-hardware.md ssh-tutorial.md sftp\u0026gt; Now if for some reason I\u0026rsquo;ve lost those files, I can copy them back with the get command.\nsftp\u0026gt; lls sftp\u0026gt; get nixos-hardware.md Fetching /home/ami/nixos-hardware.md to nixos-hardware.md sftp\u0026gt; get ssh-tutorial.md Fetching /home/ami/ssh-tutorial.md to ssh-tutorial.md sftp\u0026gt; lls nixos-hardware.md ssh-tutorial.md sftp\u0026gt; To see all the available commands in sftp we can type help and press enter.\nClient Configuration # We may face some situations where we are constantly accessing to the same server, and it becomes repetitive to write the same username and IP address over and over again. To those cases, SSH allows up to create a config file under ~/.ssh/config to declare our servers so we can use an alias instead of running the entire command. These declarations uses the following syntax:\nHost \u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; Hostname \u0026lt;ip-address\u0026gt; User \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; IdentityFile \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; ... Host \u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; Hostname \u0026lt;ip-address\u0026gt; User \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; IdentityFile \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; ... In our example, we could declare the server and call it myserver, setting the IP address, the username and the path to the SSH key respectively:\nHost myserver Hostname 192.160.122.230 User myssh-user IdentityFile /home/matteo/.ssh/myserver So now we can simply pass myserver as the argument to ssh and it will automatically translate the alias to the real target and will use our key.\n[matteo@nixos:~]$ ssh myserver Linux deb-homelab 6.1.0-37-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.140-1 (2025-05-22) x86_64 The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

This is especially the case on laptops, since they\u0026rsquo;re in constant exposure to the external world, and on enterprise and governmental computers, where a leak of information could compromise the personal data of a large number of persons. LUKS is currently the most powerful and widely adopted solution for disk encryption on Linux. In this guide I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to use LUKS to encrypt your disks, how to configure it to automatically mount on boot, and how to manage different passphrases to unlock the partition.\nRequirements # Before continuing with the guide, we should first install the cryptsetup package, which provides the utils for managing LUKS.\nIf we are using Debian/Ubuntu we must run:\nsudo apt install cryptsetup Or in the case we\u0026rsquo;re using a Fedora/RHEL derivative:\nsudo dnf install cryptsetup-luks We\u0026rsquo;ll also using parted for partitioning the disk, so make sure you have it installed, or use your prefered tool.\nsudo apt install parted # Debian/Ubuntu sudo dnf install parted # Fedora/RHEL Creating an encrypted partition # Open the terminal and find which disk/partition you want to encrypt. In my case, I have two virtual disks, vda and vdb, and I\u0026rsquo;ll use the last to store my sensitive data.\n[root@nixos:~]$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS vda 253:0 0 20G 0 disk ├─vda1 253:1 0 1.9G 0 part └─vda2 253:2 0 18.1G 0 part vdb 253:16 0 20G 0 disk The first step is to format the disk/partition as a LUKS device. To do so we have to run cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/disk and set the passphrase we want to use to protect the data.\n[root@nixos:~]$ cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vdb WARNING! ======== This will overwrite data on /dev/vdb irrevocably. Are you sure? (Type \u0026#39;yes\u0026#39; in capital letters): YES Enter passphrase for /dev/vdb: Verify passphrase: [root@nixos:~]$ This completely wiped the disk, so all the data that was there now is lost. To start working with it, we have to unlock the device using the cryptsetup open command.\n[root@nixos:~]$ cryptsetup open /dev/vdb encrypted-disk Enter passphrase for /dev/vdb: [root@nixos:~]$ I\u0026rsquo;ll call it encrypted-disk so it\u0026rsquo;s more easy to recognize it. Now the device is available under /dev/mapper/encrypted-disk. Replace the last part with the name you gave. I\u0026rsquo;ll format it as a BTRFS filesystem and mount it at /mnt\n[root@nixos:~]$ mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/encrypted-disk btrfs-progs v6.11 See https://btrfs.readthedocs.io for more information.

We can find it at /etc/crypttab and the syntax of each line is like it follows:\nvolume-name device key-file options In our example, I should configure it like this, using the UUID of the disk to identify it. We can get the UUID running cryptsetup luksUUID.\n[root@nixos:~]$ cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/vdb 283c80cf-04ee-42f4-afe8-4b51bc124498 On /etc/crypttab:\nencrypted-disk UUID=283c80cf-04ee-42f4-afe8-4b51bc124498 none luks Now we add an entry to /etc/fstab to mount it automatically on boot:\n/dev/mapper/encrypted-disk /mnt btrfs defaults 0 2 And the last step is to update the initram so the changes are applied:\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all Managing passphrases # LUKS permits us to set multiple keys to unlock the encrypted disk, allowing for more flexibility. Cryptsetup provides commands for both adding and removing passphrases from the disk.\nAdd key # To add a new passphrase to our setup, we can use the cryptsetup luksAddKey command, followed by the device we want to modify.\n[root@nixos:~]$ cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/vda Enter any existing passphrase: Enter new passphrase for key slot: Verify passphrase: [root@nixos:~]$ It will prompt us to enter the already existent passphrase we\u0026rsquo;ve set up, and the new passphrases we want to add.\nRemove key # To remove a passphrase from the LUKS device, we use cryptsetup luksRemoveKey and pass the device as the argument.\n[root@nixos:~]$ cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/vda Enter passphrase to be deleted: [root@nixos:~]$ It will ask us for the passphrase we want to remove and it will delete it from the list.\nConclusion # In this article I\u0026rsquo;ve showed you all the commands related to LUKS you need to know to encrypt a disk to protect sensitive data.
